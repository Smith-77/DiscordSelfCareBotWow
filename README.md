# Self Care Discord Bot
This is a Discord bot to promote wellness and self-care in any given Discord channel. Use this link (https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=805124602719633498&permissions=1567808&scope=bot) to try to add the bot to your Discord guild. (The bot is not currently always running on a server - coming soon!)
# Mental Health
Sends encouraging messages
Sends GIFS
Directs you to verified therapists
Sends you links to mental health awareness websites and suicide and depression phone lines
Directs to discord servers of therapists and wise/open-minded people
# Bullying
Gives you advice for handling bullying like talking to teachers or adults. If another server member is cyberbullying, the bot will DM user if they want us to ban the bully (without mentioning their name of course)
Inappropriate words will be banned and blocked by the bot. This will warn the user and after five warnings, the user is banned.
Goes to websites about bullying and how to help if you witness bullying
# Stress
Recommends activities to relieve stress. Asks what’s wrong. If you have trouble in school, just tell the bot in what subject/topic, and it will direct you to khan academy. If you have trouble in employment, it can direct you to job-finding websites. If you are having trouble with your co-workers, it can direct you to Basecamp, a product management website. If you are struggling with relationships, it will take you to relationship advice servers or if you are looking for a new one, it will direct you to a match making website.
# Self-Care
Gives healthy snack ideas while taking into consideration age, gender, and how much they exercise
Also gives skin care advice based on your skin type; dry, acne, etc.
Also gives fun activities like yoga, walking, frisbee, biking, hiking, tennis
Occasionally it sends positive messages to the discord members (randomized and with fun gifs)
Enables users to send anonymous compliments (could easily be abused though, so we’d have to set up a system of anonymous reporting and kicking, etc. could get complicated)
You can command the bot through !food, !skin, and !exercise.
If the bot detects that you've been on discord for a while, it can DM you these activities automatically.
